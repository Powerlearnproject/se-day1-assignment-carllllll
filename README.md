# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of creating computer instructions known as code to guide the computer to do a certain task.
Software engineering is important because it allows us to create programs that are helpful in solving simple issues that people may face.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering 
The Rise of Agile Methodologies
The Advent of DevOps

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Problem analysis-Gather and analyze user needs and issues
Planning- Define project scope, timeline and resources needed for the project.
Design- Design the system used to solve the user problem
Implementation- Coding of the designed system into an actual program
Testing-  Checking for any bugs and issues noticed in the program
Maintenance- Ensuring no further are realised as the program is used 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is more rigid as opposed to the agile methodology which is more flexible to changes. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software engineer- Designs, develops and maintains software applicaions.
Quality assurance engineer - Ensures the software meets quality standards 
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and completion of projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Bugs- To overcome bugs software engineers can typical use debugging methods like dry running through the written code or using debugging softwares 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Testing individual componenets of software.
Integration testing- Testing done to determine interraction between units
system testing- Testing the entire software system
Acceptance testing- Testing whether the system is ready for release 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
